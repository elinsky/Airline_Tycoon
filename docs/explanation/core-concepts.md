# Core Concepts

Understanding the fundamental concepts of Airline Tycoon is essential for both players and developers. This guide explains the key systems and mechanics that drive the game.

## The Airline Business Model

At its core, Airline Tycoon simulates the complex business of running an airline. Players must balance:

- **Revenue Generation**: Ticket sales, cargo operations, and ancillary services
- **Cost Management**: Fuel, maintenance, staff, airport fees, and aircraft leasing
- **Network Planning**: Route selection, hub development, and schedule optimization
- **Fleet Management**: Aircraft purchasing, leasing, and retirement decisions

## Time and Turns

The game operates on a daily turn system with three phases:

1. **Morning Phase**: Review overnight reports, adjust schedules
2. **Afternoon Phase**: Handle events, make strategic decisions
3. **Evening Phase**: Financial updates, competitor actions

## Key Performance Indicators

### Load Factor
The percentage of available seats filled on flights. Target: 80%+

```
Load Factor = (Passengers Carried / Available Seats) × 100
```

### Revenue per Available Seat Mile (RASM)
Measures how effectively an airline generates revenue from its capacity.

```
RASM = Total Revenue / (Available Seats × Miles Flown)
```

### Cost per Available Seat Mile (CASM)
Measures the unit cost of flying one seat one mile.

```
CASM = Total Operating Costs / (Available Seats × Miles Flown)
```
